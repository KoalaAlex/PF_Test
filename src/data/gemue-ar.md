intention: [
  "The main idea for this project was to find an interesting and immersive way to present products of Gemue to their customers with the help of AR technology on mobile devices. This was achieved through the metaphor of a catalog where users are able to select a product they want to see in three dimensions. This product can then be placed into the real world. Users are even able to derive additional information when interacting with the object. Around eight interactive product objects were implemented in the application."

process: [
  "Apples ARKit technology was used in order to create this project. While it was very helpful for quick development it was also quiet time consuming to deploy the Xcode project all the time in order to test the AR behavior. In the middle of the development process my team and I discovered the ARKit remote feature which enables you to test directly within the Unity Editor while connecting your iPhone via lightning cable. This saved us a lot of time and helped to speed up the development.",
  "The Gemue AR App was the first project that weâ€™ve created using the Unity Cinemachine. However we were also facing some problems with this framework. It was a big problem to switch between the cameras without having a significant frame drop of the application. We managed to overcome this issue by scripting our own camera interpolation switch instead of relying on the original one, which instantiate the new camera after clicking. This is a no go for mobile devices."

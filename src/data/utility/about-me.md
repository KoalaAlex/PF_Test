text: "As a front-end developer I am confident that with the help of the right approaches like
agile software development and user centered design almost all technical and human
problems can be solved. Working closely with designers and other developers is a very
natural thing for me. I love to bring distinct and delightful experiences to life. More
importantly these solutions have to serve the ultimate goal to make the users lives
easier!"

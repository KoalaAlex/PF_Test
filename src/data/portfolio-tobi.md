intention: [
  "My Bother wants an online portfolio for his projects just like I did with my online portfolio. As an UI Designer he wanted to make the concept and design by himself. So we separated the work. I was responsible for development and my brother for the design, so that he can present also his skills right at the start."

process: [
  "We started with an Invision Project as an prototyping process and. I got the screens an the layout for the first screens. Before I started with coding, I had a short discussion with my brother about elements that can be chaged and the elements that are fixed. This was necessary to start with the concept of the react modules and which parameters inherited from the parent.",
  "After the first Milestone me and my brother had a discussion about improvements and some changes to make the user experience es smooth as possible. ",
  "At the time of development the new Hook System for the React was introduced. So I decided to change all my classes into javascript functions that uses the new feature. With this change the code looked nicer and more reusable.",
  "The portfolio is currently under development and it is missing the correct texts and images."

projectType: "Windows Touch Application"

intention: [
  "This application was designed to be shown at an exhibition for the company Voith. The need of the client was to present his product in an interactive and playful way. It should include the new cooperate identity of Voith. This was a very important requirement from the client and we needed to make sure we are following the guidelines pixel perfect. The target platform for this project was a windows touch based device."

process: [
  "For these kind of projects the cinemachine technology is really handy to use. This also ensured that we were able to reuse some assets from other projects in order to create smooth camera movement. The interaction for the camera movement utilized basic touch inputs (e.g. pinch, swipe and tap).",
  "Hotspots within the UI were used to show additional information and trigger actions on the 3D object. The high performance hotspot had the most logical connections implemented. The accelerate and decelerate buttons were connected to the speed of he train. Besides that an event system/animator calls specific events at a specific timepoints.",
  "To prevent end of int/float values and weird camera bugs with the infinitely moving train we managed to rotate the surroundings in a big loop by not moving the train directly. This created the illusion of moving a moving train. This approach also saved us from many performance issues related to the train object that has many vertices."
